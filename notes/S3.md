# S3

### SignedURL

allow clients to send and receive data by directly communicating with the file store. This saves the server from using its bandwidth to serve as the intermediary that transmits data to and from the client. This is faster for clients as well.

**CORS**: Cross Origin Resource Sharing: defines how a client can interact with a resource, and what the client can and cannot do with that resource. Setting the CORS policy of our S3 bucket allows our client to communicate with the S3 bucket using the SignedURL pattern. It can be access from the bucket page --> permissions --> CORS configuration

Use this policy to create a bucket where we can use the SignedURL pattern (simple example from Udacity).

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>DELETE</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```
