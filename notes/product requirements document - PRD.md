# product requirements document - PRD

### What?

A product requirements document defines the product you are about to build: It outlines the product's purpose, its features, functionalities and behavior. **It explain What and not How**.

failure to document requirements can lead to wildly different assumptions. You share the PRD with (and seek input from) stakeholders - business and technical teams who will help build, launch or market your product.

Once all stakeholders are aligned, the PRD serves as a compass, providing clear direction toward a product's purpose while creating a shared understanding among business and technical teams.

### Example of a PRD

The product curation company Product Hunt shows that a PRD doesn’t need to be 100 pages long — just define the problems the product will solve with a general description of features.

Good product managers not only keep PRDs up-to-date on a daily or weekly basis, but they view the entire PRD process as ongoing — the document is never truly complete, it simply evolves as the team iterates.

The four core sections of a PRD:

1. defining purpose - discuss the user problems, not the solutions that must be adressed. *Who* is it for and *why*
2. descrbing features
3. setting release criteria - describing goals for when to release, for expample realse a beta version.
4. sketching rough timing
