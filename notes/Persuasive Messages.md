# Persuasive Messages

### What?

 persuasion is the ability to effectively describe the benefits and logic of an idea to gain agreement.
 Studies have shown how little people generally trust strangers. Surprisingly, studies have even shown that people trust loved ones even less than strangers, suggesting that even familiarity doesn’t compel us to trust people or believe what they say. Furthermore, the fact that people are subject to the false-consensus bias – we tend to believe that people agree with us when they do not – obscures when we need to be persuasive.

 ### Tips

 * Have confident - Research shows humans prefer cockiness to expertise. We naturally assume confidence equates with skill. be bold. Stop saying, "I think" or "I believe." Stop adding qualifiers to your speech. If you think something will work, say it will work. If you believe something will work, say it will work.
* Research shows that gaining agreement has an enduring effect, even if only over the short term. So instead of jumping right to the end of your argument, start with statements or premises you know your audience will agree with.
* If your audience is likely to disagree, speak faster. If your audience is likely to agree, speak slower.
* be yourself. Authenticity is always more persuasive.
* Always know your audience. Don't push for instant agreement if someone's personality style makes that unlikely. But don't ask for thought and reflection if your audience loves to make quick decisions and move on.
* sharing an opposing viewpoint or two is more persuasive than sticking solely to your argument.  Talk about the things they're already considering. Discuss potential negatives and show how you will mitigate or overcome those problems. 
* Then focus on drawing positive conclusions.
* women are "more focused on relationships," so in-person communication tends to be more effective. men tend to feel competitive in person and turn what should be a conversation into a contest we think we need to win. so if you don't know someone choose the right format.
* make sure you're right.
