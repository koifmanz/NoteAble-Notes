# EXPLAIN

### pgMustard documentation - glossary


After a lot of time looking at query plans, weâ€™re still coming across new operation types, fields, and terminology. 
Many of these terms were tricky to look up and understand, so we decided to share descriptions and useful links for many of the most common in a glossary.

As well as a (performance focused) description and links to related pages, we also try to include further reading and links to official documentation where relevant.
