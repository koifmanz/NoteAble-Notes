# Building a Business Case

### What is it?

To get the board or management to approve a project, it is necessary to build a business case that demonstrates why the project is needed and what the benefits of the project will be when it is finalized. The reasons and benefits of a project may seem perfectly obvious to you and others intimately involved with it; however, it may not be so apparent to stakeholders and other decision-makers. Often, they deal with a myriad of different business units and objectives and tasks that need to be done. A well-prepared business case can help your project stand out amongst the competing priorities within the organization and may be the key to getting approval and finances for the project. 

The business case is a process to critically examine the opportunities, alternatives, project stages, and financial investment to make a recommendation for the best course of action that will create business value.

### Components 

1. **Executive Summary** - The Executive summary summarizes the entire document, including the recommendation. You want to make sure that it has enough detail that if it’s the only thing people read they will understand the justifications for building the product. It’s also the first thing people read and usually the last thing you will write to make sure that everything is cohesive.
2. **Problem Statement** - The Problem Statement explains the problem you are trying to solve, as well as the associated goals. It should also clearly link the problem back to the business strategy and goals.
3. **Analysis of Product Opportunity** In the Analysis of Product Opportunity section, you discuss the merits of why solving the problem is important. You’ll usually want to touch on the cost of the problem and the size of the opportunity. Additionally, you can discuss what would happen if you didn’t solve the problem.
4. **Possible Solutions** - In the Possible Solutions section, you will describe the potential solutions to the problem. For each solution, you should discuss benefits, cost, timeline, and risks.
5. **Recommended Approach** - in the Recommended Approach section, you put forward your recommendation for which solution is the best and why.
