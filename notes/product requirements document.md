# product requirements document

### What?

A product requirements document defines the product you are about to build: It outlines the product's purpose, its features, functionalities and behavior.

</p>

Next, you share the PRD with (and seek input from) stakeholders - business and technical teams who will help build, launch or market your product.

Once all stakeholders are aligned, the PRD serves as a compass, providing clear direction toward a product's purpose while creating a shared understanding among business and technical teams.
