# Identifying Requirements

### The two most common challenges are:
  1. Never be sure that all requirements have been identified.
  2. Userse might not be able to tell you what the product should do, you need to focus on understanding their problems and needs. ask why, and then ask why again.

### What are the characteristics of a good requirement?
  1. Inconsistent interpretations would lead to disappointment.
  2. Allow design freddom by giving context (who and for what)
  3. Based on real wants and wishes of the users.

## product requirements document - PRD

### What?

A product requirements document defines the product you are about to build: It outlines the product's purpose, its features, functionalities and behavior. **It explain What and not How**.

failure to document requirements can lead to wildly different assumptions. You share the PRD with (and seek input from) stakeholders - business and technical teams who will help build, launch or market your product.

Once all stakeholders are aligned, the PRD serves as a compass, providing clear direction toward a product's purpose while creating a shared understanding among business and technical teams.

### Example of a PRD

The product curation company Product Hunt shows that a PRD doesn’t need to be 100 pages long — just define the problems the product will solve with a general description of features.

Good product managers not only keep PRDs up-to-date on a daily or weekly basis, but they view the entire PRD process as ongoing — the document is never truly complete, it simply evolves as the team iterates.

The four core sections of a PRD:

1. defining purpose - discuss the user problems, not the solutions that must be adressed. *Who* is it for and *why*
2. descrbing features
3. setting release criteria - describing goals for when to release, for expample realse a beta version.
4. sketching rough timing
